# Gratitude Log

Gratitude Log is a program to keep a diary of things you are grateful for, and to transform these data into insights.

## Goals of the program:

* Cultivate the attention to gratitude
* Keep track of goal-oriented behavior
* Support a data-driven lifestyle

> category...Name:
> categoryNName:

* First letter of the day of week (Estonian and English are supported)
* Date in the following format day.month.year
* Title
* Category name (e.g. joy, develop, tip, location) followed by a colon. You can have as many categories as you wish.
